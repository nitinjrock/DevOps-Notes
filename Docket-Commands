## Docker Architecture:- 
Below 3 components are running in Docker Arch. 
1. Docker Engine 
- DOcker engine run Container
2. Docker Demon --> Dockerd --> Containerd
- Docker Demon/Dockerd/COntainerd, this manage Container activitys
3. Docker CLI  
- Docker CLI work as "COmmand line Interface"

Que. How container Get created ?
1. User pass docker run command to create Container which will execute using Docker CLI
2. Once command in passed, Docker Demon/Dockerd/Continerd, it create Container per image instructions
3. Once Container is created it get created using DOcker Engine, which is used to run Container

Docker Comands and points:
#  docker run -itd --name <container_name> <image_name or ID> /bin/bash
Command options below:
 run  --> to create container from docker image 
  i  --> Interactive mode
  t  --> terminal 
 d --> run container in deatach mode (run container in background mode)
 /bin/bash = create container in bash shell  
 
## Docker Build Commands
- docker build -t <image_name> .    --> this will create image of docker file where docker file is present in current dir (image_name  you can give per ur wish)
eg - docker build -t two-tier-backend .  --> here we build image with name two-tier-backend and docker file present in present dir

## Create SQL DB contaier & create DB 

- docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql  --> this will create docker container (this is env variable passed to create password: -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root) (mysql is image name)

----------- Below command are to create db and show created db
Note -  once you inter in sql container run below command to login to sql
- docker exec -it ded8309c7492 bash  --> used to login to sql container 
-  mysql -u root -p  --> once you to inside container run this command to login to sql (password is root, which is define in above command)
- show databases;  --> used to check created DB in container sql
- create databases devops; --> this will create "devops" databases in sql

- docker ps 
- docker ps -a 
- docker start <container_id or name>  --> start the container 
- docker stop <container_id or name>  --> stop the container 
- docker restart <container_id or name>  --> restart the container 
- docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash   --> Go inside the container
- docker exec -it <container_id> sh  --> this is used to go inside container, where bash is not install or slime and sh command work to go inside container
- docker logs <container-id>            --> check container logs (know days there are tools which used to check/monitor logs, Tools: Graphana)
- docker rm  --> delete stoped container
- docker rmi  --> delete docker image
- docker inspect <cntainer_ID/Image_Name> --> It will describe detailed info of container or Image 
- docker commit <container_ID> <custome image name>  --> this will create custome image of running container
- docker login   --> used to login (provide Dockerhub credentials)
- docker network ls --> Show docker networking details 
- docker create network <bridge network> or <host network> or <none network>
- docker network inspect <network name>  --> show network details, which container is using this netowkr
- docker system info --> this will show docker info like containers, running containers no,stop container no,number of images on host & swarm status 

- Docker port mapping:  docker run --itd -p 5050:8080 --name dev_jenkins jenkins/jenkins /bin/bash
(5050 is Docker host VM port {VM port should be unique }  // 8080: container port / apploication defuld port)
Docker folder/Dir structure: Docker has dir sturcture for container, image, vloume, network etc  (Path: cd /var/lib/docker)
--------------------------------------------------
Container Logs check commands:
- docker logs <container_id>
- docker logs <container_id> --timestamps
- docker logs <container_id> --since (or --until) YYYY-MM-DD
- docker logs <container_id> --tail N  (The --tail flag will show the last N lines of logs:)
- docker logs <container_id> | grep -i error
- docker attach <container_id> -------------> this command will attach container terminal with your terminal and show running logs on container (No need to run log command every time)

Docker Networking: (When you install docker, by default it will create 3 networks)
- NOTE: Below network are also know as Network drivers
    i. Bridge network: This network will paly main role for whole docker system, which help container to communicate with each other 
   ii. host network: this network help to host to container communication or container to host communication 
   iii. null : No sence of creating container in null network 
   iv. MACVLAN : (this are out dated netowkr - which is used in Docker Sware)
   v. IPVLAN : (this are out dated netowkr - which is used in Docker Sware)
  - docker network ls --> will display docker network info
- docker network create <network_name> -d brigde  --> create your own bridge network (Network name - any u can give) (here -d is know as network drive)
*********************************************************************************************************************
********************************************** Docker File Options & Structure:**************************************
Dockerfile Instructions:

1. FROM: define the base image, Dockerfile always starts with FROM parameter/instruction. this is the smallest Dockerfile
(min number of docker layers)
2. MAINTAINER : description of dockerfile, ownner name/email address .
3. RUN:  you execute a command (linux)/script during image creation (not the container creation), in real we use RUN to download code dependancy
4. WORKDIR: set directory as a working directory/present working directory/home directory
5. COPY: copy/download the file/folder but only FROM DOKCER HOST VM (source) to docker image (destination)
6. ADD: copy/download the file/folder FROM DOKCER HOST VM/WEB URL/INTETNET (source) to docker image (destination)
7. ENTRYPOINT: ENTRYPOINT is similar to CMD, using ENTRYPOINT we can run/execute command/script duing container creation not the image creation.
8. EXPOSE: expose default application/container port (not port forwarding/port mapping)
vi Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
Q. Can we have multiple "FROM" in dockerfile?
ans: yes, multistage dockerfile
************************************************************************************************************************
************************************************* Docker Volume & Storage **********************************************
Docker Volume: In docker when we create container, there should be place where data of container should be stored. 
               For this purpose docker Voulmes are created
             - Note: When we create container default data is stored within container and if we restart/delete container data will loss, so volume is required
			 - we can create volume during creating container with docker file
			 - Docker volumes are also shared within container (eg. one container to another container)
			 - With help of Volume if we delete or remove container, data storage will still available in volume
			 
Docker Volume command:
- docker volume create my_volume1  (this will create docker volume.. Note: It is just created, not attached to container)
- docker volume ls (list the created volumes)
- docker volume inspect volume_name (Show details of volume)
- docker volume rm volume_name (it remove the volume)
- docker volume prune (remove all unused volumes which are not used by any containers)

##Lab to create container by using volume in docker run command as below:
1 Step: docker pull jenkins:2.60.3  (pull Jenkins image form docker hub)
2 Step: docker run --name myJenkins  -v volume_name:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
                 (-p 8080:8080 this will access port 8080 on local system)
				 (-p 50000:50000, this port is used for API services)
				 (--name myJenkins, is contaier name)
				 (-v volume_name:/var/jenkins_home, this will fetch data from Jenkins path /var/jenkins_home to volume)
3. Step: Create docker container by using same volume and just change ports as showned in below command and in this way we can share volume with other contaier
--------------------------------------
Q. Where docker volume is stored?
--> /var/lib/docker/volume
- Docker volume is used to prevet data from container, in case if we restart, stop container there is chance to loss of data, so docker volume is used
- This volumes are stores in part of host filesystem 
- name pipes volume(mount): it is used communicate between docker host and containers
--> command to map volume (docker -v /home/mount/data:/var/lib/mysql/data)
**************************************************************************************************
***************************************** DOCKER COMPOSE *****************************************
Why Docker Compose? (yaml - yet another markup language)
- If we need to setup complex application by running multiple services on multiple COntainer, it is better way to use Docker Compose 
- With Docker Compose we can crete configuration file in yml or yaml  format (docker-compose.yml) 
****************************************************************************************************
***************************************** Dockek Swarm *********************************************
Why Docker Swarm?
- Running docker containers on single host which is good for Devlopment & Testing purpose but it is not good for production as there will be single pointt of failure of host 
- Docker Swarm will take care of distributing app services in to saprate host for high availability and load balancing 

# Steps to setup Swarm cluster: (Eg. one manager node and two worker nodes)
- Need to install docker on all 3 nodes
- docker system info | grep -i swarm --> show docker system info
- docker swarm init --> it will assign node as manager node & also it will generate token which need to run on worker nodes
- docker node ls --> it list node attach with swarm 
- docker swarm join-token worker --> It will generate token if we need to add any node at any movement .. just run generated tooken on node which need to join-token
- docker node update --availability drain worker_name --> put worker node in drain status , means not in use
- docker node update --availability active worker_name --> it bring node in active state and working mode
- docker node rm worker_naame --> remove node from cluster
- docker swarm leave --> worker node will leave swarm and removed from cluster (run this on node which you want to leave)
- docker node promote worker1 --> this will promote workernode to manager / make it manager node

## MultiStage build  Docker file
- Using Multistage docker file we can redure size of docker file. 
- Multistage build allow to use multiple FROM statemet in docker file, where each FROM will start new file and carry required compressed dependences from previous FROM statement
- You can define alise in 1st FROM stagement and use this alise name in second FROM statement, which will compress 1st FROM statement base image and carry to second image
- This help to reduce docker file size
*************************************************** Harware Virtualization vs Software Virtualization

1. There in no OS concept in Docker(Software virtualization)
2, there is no kernel conepct in docker, docker uses kernel of host operating system only to run the processes.
3. bootup time is very less in docker, it increases the application availability
4. dockers are lightweight (b'cas it contains only application related binary and library files), if something goes with container, we can easily spin up new containers.
5. Resource oprimization

##### PROJECT: Two Tier Application  -- https://github.com/nitinjrock/two-tier-flask-app.git
1.step: Created Bridge network
- docker network create two-tier -d bridge  # create bridge network

2.Step: create sql container & assign env varaibles
- docker pull sql  --> this will pull sql image
- docker run -d --name mysql --network two-tier -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=devops mysql --> run container and assign env variables

3. Login to sql DB and create database as devops
--- Below command are to create db and show created db
Note -  once you inter in sql container run below command to login to sql
- docker exec -it ded8309c7492 bash  --> used to login to sql container 
-  mysql -u root -p  --> once you to inside container run this command to login to sql (password is root, which is define in above command)
- show databases;  --> used to check created DB in container sql
- create databases devops; --> this will create "devops" databases in sql
- use devops  ---> this will use devops DB
- select * from messages;  --> this will show data added to your devops db under messages table

4.Step: Create docker image from git repo above and create container
- docker build -t two-tier-backend . 
- docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --network two-tier -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DB=devops two-tier-backend 
- docker logs <container_id>  --> check container is runnig and able to communicate with DB container

5. Step: Attach Docker volume to sql container
Note - There are two types of Voulme 1.Docker named voulme (which you can create docker volume and attach), 2. You can direct attach any host machine path in run command
- docker run -d --name mysql --network two-tier -v /home/ubuntu/two-tier-flask-app/db_voulme_me_created:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=devops mysql
